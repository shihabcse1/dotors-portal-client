                    The Doctor’s Portal provides health organizations that
                    strive for excellence and quality care, with a tool that
                    allows physicians to measure themselves against key
                    performance indicators set by the organization. This tool
                    helps optimize physician practices in compliance with the
                    organization’s guidelines, offering valuable statistics.
                    Health organizations can easily get creative with this tool
                    by setting targets for practices, and even promoting healthy
                    competition between physicians to increase engagement in
                    providing useful metrics, and overall better quality of
                    service.
